            "response": "To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand microtransactions. The intent is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of Austrian economics most of the money will fly right out of a typical gamer‚Äôs wallet. There‚Äôs also EA‚Äôs opportunistic scheming, which is deftly woven into its monetization- its corporate philosophy draws heavily from Hobbesian literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the sense of pride and accomplishment, to realize that they‚Äôre not just looking at average per-player credit earn rates on a daily basis- they say something deep about challenges that are compelling, rewarding, and OF COURSE attainable via GAMEPLAY.\n\nAs a consequence, people who dislike Star Wars‚Ñ¢ Battlefront‚Ñ¢ 2 truly ARE armchair developers- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in EA‚Äôs existential catchphrase ‚ÄúIt's In The Game,‚Äù which itself is an ironic reference to Norah McClintock‚Äôs young adult novel Truth And Lies. I‚Äôm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated nerf herders providing candid feedback in earnest as EA‚Äôs avarice unfolds itself on their computer screens. What sheep.. how I pity them. üòÇ\n\nAnd yes, by the way, i DO have a Star Wars‚Ñ¢ Battlefront‚Ñ¢ 2 tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It‚Äôs for the Twi'leks‚Äô eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they‚Äôre within 60,000 credits of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel armchair developer üòé",

I was taking zinc supplements so I was shooting massive loads and it became something of a sport to me. For anyone interested here is your best strategy. first, you need to find an isolated spot so you don't become a sex offender. I found a short kind of channel area where I saw the pigeons would congregate. Next, you arouse yourself. I was usually content with envisioning the occasional jogging lady coming over and taking a shit on my chest and that was enough to fuel the fire but if you're not as sexually charged as me just take some porn on the go. After you're good an horny, you get some bread. My pigeons preferred white bread but healthier birds might have a taste for honey wheat or maybe even multigrain. Fat, unhealthy birds are slower and easier to hit so remember that. Once you are seated on the bench and ready to do the deed, whip your roosevelt out and scatter bread out within a few feet of you. use your judgement based on how far you know you can cum. I was a lonely and depraved soul who could hit targets the size of a thimble at distances up to 4 feet. You wait for the pigeons to begin eating and to get comfortable with your presence. At this point, you want to coo gently and talk sensually to them to gain their trust. Now you're finally ready to cum on your bird. This is a tough part because the rapid motion of masturbation is very frightening to the birds, so you have to be subtle. Once you master a technique, you simply wind it up and let it go, aiming depending on your past cumming experiences. I always came high so I would aim for the neck of the bird and catch it right in the face. It's an extremely satisfying and erotic feeling, seeing those birds reel around covered in cum and maybe even transporting it to other places in the city.",

Well lately weve been renovating the office and things are pretty tight in there to move around it kinda like a maze or some shiit. Well today im going out on break and theres these 2 desks beside eachother and theres barely any room for 2 people to walk by in and wut do i see, my boss walking towards me.\nI try to act cool but my face becomes flushed and it doesnt help that her tits are bouncing up and down as she walks, we get to the point of the desks at the same time and we kinda awkwardly try to walk by each other. We kinda get stuck a bit by the desks and shes facing away from me and her ass is right on my crotch, the second i feel this im in pure ecstasy and acquire a semi instantly. Her big juicy angus and me are now stuck and were trying to squeeze by each other and slowly moving through but her ass is grinding right up on me, i know i am about to cum and i tell her to move faster for the love of god, shes like wtf but i cannot stop at this point.\nI blow the biggest load this month so far and i get transported to another dimension, my fat load starts to leak through my pants and onto her skirt, shes turns her head and see this and says omg are u serious. We finally seperate and i fall to my knees and begin to speak in tongues, waves of more orgasms flood over me, i crap my pants and begin to cry. I was immediately fired but i feel like a new man now and will masturbate to this memory forever.",

Wait a bit for people to buy prints, and then post up the original for an amount proportional based on the sales figures\nThat would be another possible explanation for why some paintings are unlisted, not enough prints have been bought for Rev to garner how much he should sell the original for\nThough that rounds right back to the original point\nWhy was Egg half the price of the other two paintings I asked about?\nEgg was painted after Hermes.JPG, but before Witch Hunt\nThe prints are available in different sizes, which cost variable amounts, so maybe it's based on gross income from all sizes sold?\nAll I have really to go off here is speculation since me and Rev didn't talk too much during dealings with my purchase\nWe mainly discussed how much shipping would charge, although it would've been an opportune moment to ask him about any of this",

Suddenly, a dark, nondescript van with \"free beer\" scrawled on the side slowly creeps up from behind me. The window rolls down and staring at me is a young blue-haired girl with pigtails, maybe about 9 years old, eyeing me up suspiciously. She calls out in a slightly hushed voice:\n-\"Hey... Hey buddy. You want some classic rock cd's? I've got a ton in the back.\"\nI was told never to speak to little girls I didn't know, but the offer was so enticing I foolishly replied\n\"R-really? D-do you have The Beatles? O-or maybe Bob Seger?\"\nShe chuckled darkly, \"Oh yeah, I've got everything. The Who, Floyd, Tom Petty, you name it. But you'll have to hop in the back here if you want me to give them to you.\"\nI knew I should have ran, but part of me was too scared of what she might do if I said no, as I walked to the back I could swear I saw her licking her lips out of the corner of my eye.\nAs I reached for the handle the doors suddenly flung open and about five lolis reached out and grabbed me.\nI screamed as loud as I could, but one of them gagged me with her panties and they pulled me in with their mighty loli strength.\nThey pinned me down, as I struggled I heard one of them say \"Sit on the bitch's face, Sanae. Shut him the fuck up\".\nSuddenly my vision was then completely obscured and my screams muffled by pink softness, with what looked like a cartoon bear's face on the back.\nAs tears rolled down my cheeks they laughed at my pointless struggle. It was at that point I realized there really was no rock",

All this virus is, is an attempt to cover up 5G, and I‚Äôm sure many of you have heard that theory now, but it is actually true. The government wants us to be in fear, so well ask for a vaccine. The government is smart, they come out with some virus that claims to have killed thousands of people in only a few months, so of course, people will be on their hands and knees, begging for a vaccination. But, once they do come out with this vaccination, it will control us, and the government will monitor everything we do. It will know everything about us, and it will control you.",

I suspect they might just reveal some new content on Twitter or we might get a Nintendo Direct on the 16th. Even if he is the 5th character, I hope they give us a hint or something at the next fighter cause I'm gonna be honest. The last two DLC characters have done nothing for me. I played a little bit of Banjo but stopped caring, and while Terry is fun, he's also complex as hecc and I can't do super complex characters. So the last two DLC fighters just haven't done anything for me. It's a bit selfish, but I would like this last character to be a fighter I actually care about.\nWell I take it all back. It's probably Dante\nBut I do hope they show off one more character. Hopefully a Nintendo character this time\nI'm a little sick of all these third party characters. There's a ton of Nintendo characters they can still add\nNot that they all haven't been great\nBanjo is iconic, so is Terry, Hero comes from Dragon Quest and Joker from the hottest JRPG Persona 5\nAnd if Dante gets in, yet another iconic character",

            "response": "so i just watched the dbd devstream and they clarified a few changes abt the perks n shit\nProve Thyself DOES stack, which means you can gain up to a 30% personal buff to repair speed if there are three survivors around you. however, this is offset by a returning mechanic; diminishing returns for multiple survivors working on one generator. whenever someone other than you is working on the same generator, you receive a 10% personal debuff to gen repair speed. this means two survivors working on one generator would repair at 180% speed rather than 200% speed, setting the maximum repair speed at 360%, perks and toolboxes notwithstanding. this can be almost completely offset if all four survivors are running Prove Thyself, but that's a fringe case obviously. overall this is a nerf to survivor repair speed.\nthe changes to Self Care will NOT be going live in the next patch; it'll remain as it is. instead, a new shared perk will be created in a future patch that is similar to \"selfish care.\"\nthe changes to the Legion's deep wound effect will not be going live thankfully. the devs are looking into other ways to encourage healing vs the Legion.",

I had a bad feeling about this. ‚ÄúWhich one?‚Äù I ask shakily, not wanting to hear the answer. ‚ÄúDespacito‚Äù She responds. I begin to hyperventilate. My worst fears have been realized. I fade in and out of conciseness. I clamp my palms over my ears, but I know it‚Äôs futile. The song plays. I‚Äôm crying now, praying. God, Allah, Buddha please help me. I curl up on the floor. There‚Äôs nothing I can do now. And then it happens. The chorus plays. The girls in my class open their mouths. The screams of the damned, the shrieks of the tortured fill my ears and bounce around my skull. My eardrums rupture, blood leaking out. I try to scream, but no sound comes out. I can only sit there, violently shaking as it happens to me. After what seems like hours, it‚Äôs finally over. I try to move, but I cannot make myself. My brain shuts down as my vision fades to black. I muster the last of my energy, uttering the accursed word.\n\n‚ÄúDespacito‚Äù",

He starts to feed it to me while I'm sleeping. I'm a light sleeper, so this wakes me up, naturally I was confused, even more so because of the disorientation of sleep. He woke me up completely and told me that he 'got me some chocolate'. I ate it, as I was tired and unsure if I was having some sort of weird dream or what. After I ate it he told me that he'd rubbed it on our dogs nose before giving it to me. I didn't really care because I was so tired and just went back to sleep. The next morning I didn't really say anything because I was very confused and I wasn't sure if it was real. However, it kept happening, and he started asking me about it the morning after. One time he told me he farted on it before he fed it to me.\n\nHe also farts at me out the window often whenever I'm outside doing something. One time he farted at a kid who looked a little like me, and his parents came over and got mad at him. He still does this to me.\nAnother weird thing he does to me (or rather the dog) is grabs it's head and holds it to his ass, farts on her, and says to me, \"I wish this was you, Michael\", very angrily. Sometimes he farts multiple times on her and she tries to get away, I feel bad for her.",

When he does shit his pants, he quickly crouches down and goes behind a building or something and starts wiping his ass with whatever's available.\n\nOne time he called me while he was out on the shore, and told me how he shat while he was clam farming or something. He said he just crouched over the water between two rocks, and that there were \"leaves everywhere\" so it was easy(??).\nMy mom called me once to tell me something, and Don was with her. Don asked if she was talking to me, so she gave him the phone, and he farted into it. It was a long fart, too. After like two minutes of me wondering what just happened, he said \"Michael, are you there?\" and I said \"Yes?\" and he said \"That was me farting\". I hung up then.\n\nSo that's what my weird step dad does. I might remember some things he's done later, and I'll add them to the thread.",

I uninstalled the Duolingo app 5 days ago, but I still get the notifications demanding me to learn Spanish. On the third day, I heard a window downstairs break and found a brick on the floor. There was a note tied to it saying,‚ÄùYour time is almost up. Learn the fucking mexican words or else‚Äù. I don‚Äôt have the work ethic to dedicate the effort to learn the language, and just accepted my fate. But the next day, when I found the brakes in my car removed after causing a minor accident at a nearby intersection, I realized that I‚Äôm afraid to die. In that very moment, I received another notification saying,‚ÄúIt‚Äôs too late for practice now. Speak the Spanish all you want, I will make sure of tu muerte‚Äù. I then turned around to see what I swear was a mass of neon green feathers dart behind a tree. I did not sleep that night, and I‚Äôm thankful for it. A few hours after I went to bed, the owl appeared in my window, but quickly fled after I drew my firearm from my nightstand. That‚Äôs when I decided it was time to leave, and later stole a car parked down my street. But I know that my fate is sealed. Because every second I‚Äôm not running, he‚Äôs only getting closer. The notifications from the deleted duolingo app have been getting progressively darker and more sinister. The last one didn‚Äôt even ask me to practice learning my language. It was just the owl asserting to me that he is God. I know I‚Äôll die soon. I‚Äôve accepted it. Yet I‚Äôm still upset that my life has to end because of my inability to learn Spanish.",

The Catholic Church ultimately resolved this question by declaring that the Easter Bunny orgasmed every time it laid it an egg (which it was doing constantly). This is now codified in Canon Law (the legal code of the Catholic Church and much of Europe in the pre-modern era) and saying that the Easter Bunny does not orgasm with every egg laid is considered blasphemy and grounds for excommunication from the Church.",

Eventually, I got this strange feeling in my dick, and I had looked up how to fap a few days ago out of curiosity, so I began to rub my dick, and some squicky substance came out (you know what it is. we both do).

Would that be gay? We were wasted and while we were banging we kept calling each other fags. It's almost like a parody of when we bang chicks (remember this didn't happen). So that wouldn't make me gay right? Just a jokester?",

Every time I watch Strawinsky and the Mysterious house, I always wait for that one scene where the Globglogabgalab emerges from that book. Fuck it makes me so hard! Seeing his big, blobby form appear from nowhere just makes something... Click, within me. I instantly get an erection. I just can't help but start jacking it. When all those books come out and start dancing to his song, I get so fucking hyped that i just start windmilling my cock around. Then, when he says \"I am the Yeast of thoughts and mind\" I fucking nut all over my tv. Have you ever seen such a perfect creature? Fuck! I'm getting hard just thinking about it!",

            "response": "Good morning, everyone.\n\nMy name is Pastor Dr. Martin Sempa. I'm here in the capacity of the chariman of the national task force against homosexuality in Uganda.\n\nWe are making legislation to make sure that sodomy and homosexuality never sees the light of legality in this land of the part of Africa. I've taken time to do a little research to know what homosexuals do in the privacy of their bedroom. One of the thing they do is called anal licking, where the-, a man's anus is licked, like this, by the other person. Like ice cream. And then what happens, even poo-poo comes out. The other poo-poos out. And then they eat the poo-poo. The other one they do, is they have a sex practice called fisting where they insert their hand into the other man's hand and it goes all the-, into the anus all the way, and it is so painful they have to take drugs. But they enjoy it. Now if we have any children, please step out. This is a parental guidance moment. That child can be moved out. So, I've done research. This is what they do: Number one, you can see a man here having sucked the other person's rectum and the other person is poo-pooing, and this one is eating the poo-poo all over the place. Tell me, when you have a law against homosexuality do you say accept eating poo-poo? I mean look at these guyses here. Bishop. Aaaah, stagafiliza. Huh? Hajat? We do not want this sickness. This is sick, and it's therefore deviant; we do not want it.\n\nNow, they start off by touching each other's genitals and smearing each other. Then this one smears the poo-poo all over the other person's face. As if that is not enough he puts the hand deep. As Africans we want to ask Barrack Obama to explain to us, is this what he wants to bring to Africa? As a human right to eat the poo-poo of our children?",

Every time I go to the town hall I get a massive erection. I've seen literally every rule 34 post there is of her online. My dreams are nothing but constant fucking sex with Isabelle. I'm sick of waking up every morning with six nuts in my boxers and knowing that those are nuts that should've been busted inside of Isabelle's tight dog pussy. I want her to have my mutant human/dog babies.\n\nFuck, my fucking mom caught me with the neighbors dog. I'd dressed her in my sister's skirt and went to fucking town. She hasn't said a word to me in 10 hours and I'm worried she's gonna take away my 3DS. I might not ever get to see Isabelle again.",

I work as a carpenter for Joseph, the man who raised me, and I get home every day by 8 PM at the latest. Tobacco hasn‚Äôt made it to the old world, but I occasionally turn water into wine.\n\nI'm in bed by sundown, and make sure I get 3 days of sleep through any storm, even while sailing on the Sea of Galilee. After having a glass of warm milk and doing about twenty minutes of prayers to Yahweh before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until the third day. Just like a man resurrected, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning. I was told there were no issues at my last checkup with Luke the Physician.\n\nI'm trying to explain that I'm a person who wishes to spread the word of God The Father. I take care to love any enemies, like Pharisees and the romans. Hating them would cause me to lose sleep at night. That is how I deal with the lost, and I know that is what brings me happiness. Although, if I were to die I would resurrect in 72 hours.",

After having a glass of warm milk and doing about twenty minutes of stretches before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning. Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning. I was told there were no issues at my last check-up. I'm trying to explain that I'm a person who wishes to live a very quiet life. I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, like winning and losing, that would cause me to lose sleep at night. That is how I deal with society, and I know that is what brings me happiness. Although, if I were to fight I wouldn't lose to anyone.",

How could anyone get off to the idea of removing a loli's clothes and licking her tiny body all over, nibbling her neck and kissing her adorable little nipples? Only a heartless monster would think about her cute girlish mouth and tongue wrapped around a thick cock slick with her saliva, pumping in and out of her mouth until it erupts, the cum more then her little throat can swallow.\nThe idea of thick viscous semen overflowing, dribbling down her chin over her flat chest, her tiny hands scooping it all up and watching her suck it off her fingertips is just horrible. You're all a bunch of sick perverts, thinking of spreading her smooth slender thighs, cock poised at the entrance to her pure, tight, virginal pussy, and thrusting in deep as a whimper escapes her lips which are slippery with cum, while her small body shudders from having her cherry taken in one stroke.\nI am disgusted at how you'd get even more excited as you lean over her, listening to her quickening breath, her girlish moans and gasps while you hasten your strokes, her sweet pants warm and moist on your face and her flat chest, shiny with a sheen of fresh sweat, rising and falling rapidly to meet yours.\nIt is truly nasty how you'd run your hands all over her tiny body while you violate her, feeling her nipples hardening against your tongue as you lick her chest, her neck and her armpits, savoring the scent of her skin and sweat while she trembles from the stimulation and as she reaches her climax, hearing her cry out softly as she has her first orgasm while that cock is buried impossibly deep inside her, pusling violently as an intense amount of hot cum spurts forth and floods through her deflowered pussy for the first time, filling her womb only to spill out of her with a sickening squelch. And as you lie atop her flushed body, she sighs breathlessly and her fingers dig into your back as she feels your cock hardening inside her again. You're all sick in the head.",

            "response": "Whenever I get a package of plain M&Ms, I make it my duty to continue the strength and robustness of the candy as a species. To this end, I hold M&M duels. Taking two candies between my thumb and forefinger, I apply pressure, squeezing them together until one of them cracks and splinters. That is the ‚Äúloser,‚Äù and I eat the inferior one immediately. The winner gets to go another round. I have found that, in general, the brown and red M&Ms are tougher, and the newer blue ones are genetically inferior. I have hypothesized that the blue M&Ms as a race cannot survive long in the intense theater of competition that is the modern candy and snack-food world. Occasionally I will get a mutation, a candy that is misshapen, or pointier, or flatter than the rest. Almost invariably this proves to be a weakness, but on very rare occasions it gives the candy extra strength. In this way, the species continues to adapt to its environment. When I reach the end of the pack, I am left with one M&M, the strongest of the herd. Since it would make no sense to eat this one as well, I pack it neatly in an envelope and send it to M&M Mars, A Division of Mars, Inc., Hackettstown, NJ 17840-1503 U.S.A., along with a 3√ó5 card reading, ‚ÄúPlease use this M&M for breeding purposes.‚Äù This week they wrote back to thank me, and sent me a coupon for a free 1/2 pound bag of plain M&Ms. I consider this ‚Äúgrant money.‚Äù I have set aside the weekend for a grand tournament. From a field of hundreds, we will discover the True Champion. There can be only one.",

Commissioned by the Communist League and originally published in London (in German as Manifest der Kommunistischen Partei) just as the revolutions of 1848 began to erupt, the Manifesto was later recognised as one of the world's most influential political documents. It presents an analytical approach to the class struggle (historical and then-present) and the problems of capitalism and the capitalist mode of production, rather than a prediction of communism's potential future forms.\n\nThe Communist Manifesto summarizes Marx and Engels' theories about the nature of society and politics, that in their own words, \"The history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles\". It also briefly features their ideas for how the capitalist society of the time would eventually be replaced by socialism.",

I EVEN got her to stop rampaging and destroying everything in sight. Everybody is still afraid of her, however.\n\nThe Sapphire Weapon only has slightly better odds than my wife Reshiram when it comes to throwing me up out of her stomach (My wife has the worst odds of anything that I am swallowed by). Because the Sapphire Weapon is so huge, I can barely last a minute in her stomach before I digest. She needs to start trying to throw me up out of her stomach immediately after I reach her stomach because it usually takes a lot of tries for her to get me up out of her stomach.\n\nThe Sapphire Weapon starts crying after two minutes of trying to throw me up. This is because she knows I am digested by then.\n\nFun fact: Travelling to the Final Fantasy VII World is a two minute travel through the void after using a world portal at a portal building.",

            "response": "Undertale Sans is my favorite game character of all time. Undertale Sans embodies everything that a character should be. He's heroic, comedic, has incredible abilities, and has a nostalgic connection to the players (after all, Undertale Sans is Ness).\n\nWith the announcement of Undertale and Smash Bros. taking place in the same Direct, I thought to myself, \"Could this really be a coincidence?\" Highly unlikely. After all, a Splatoon 2 expansion and Inkling Boy/Girl were both announced, so there's no way it was purely coincidental. If you take a look at the facts, it becomes painfully obvious how Undertale Sans will not only be in the game, but will also be Smash 5's flagship character.\n\nUndertale Sans is the perfect character for the game. Not only is he iconic, but he has enough moves and abilities to make for the deepest moveset in the game. Not only can he freeze time, he can teleport, attack with bones, and even poison opponents. Not only that, but he can also use his trademarked Gaster Blasters as smash attacks. For his Final Smash, he can stand there and do nothing, forcing players to reset their consoles. A perfect win.\n\nSince Undertale Sans and Ness are the same person, it seems fitting that they should remove Ness as a separate character entirely. Instead, Undertale Sans will play like Zelda/Shiek, with players being able to switch between the two. However, Ness will be considerably weaker, forcing players to play as Undertale Sans, his strongest and most superior form.\n\nFurthermore, the story mode will revolve around Undertale Sans. How, we don't know yet, but hopefully we will soon. However, this will lead Sakurai to put Undertale Sans on the front cover, and have him at the focal point of all commercials and posters so people know that this is Undertale Sans' game.",

They both broke into a group number of, Sweet Victory because they knew... Then all knew then and there that that was what this night was going to be.\n\n\"Hey Spongebob,\" Patrick said in a hushed whisper as if someone was listening in on their conversation.\n\n\"Yeah, Pat?\" Spongebob asked, tilting his head.\n\n\"Do you like boys?\" Spongebob tilted his head to the other side.\n\n\"Of course I like boys. Why wouldn't I?\"\n\n\"I mean like like.\" Spongebob gave a drawn out \"oh\" before shrugging.\n\n\"I dunno. I've never really thought about it. Do you like boys?\" he asked. Patrick gave a curt nod.\n\n\"Yeah...\" he trialed off.\n\n\"Do you have a crush?\" Patrick gave another curt nod. \"Who?\"\n\n\"You'll hate me if I tell you...\"\n\n\"Oh Patrick, I could never hate you! You're my best friend!\" Spongebob exclaimed, wrapping the pink starfish in a tight hug. Patrick sighed and returned the hug.\n\n\"I like you, Spongebob. I always have,\" he admitted. Spongebob looked into Patrick's eyes.\n\nHe too liked Patrick, he always had. And he now understood why he felt extra special about Patrick.\n\n\"I like you too, Pat,\" Spongebob said.\n\nThe two began to make out passionately. Patrick began to grope Spongebob's spongy ass which made both boys moan loudly. Spongebob's hand began to trail down to Patrick's shorts where he could feel a bulge forming.",

Spongebob's 10 incher, erect dong sprung into the air and Patrick began sucking him off as his own 7 incher stood hard against the bed.\n\nThe song \"Now That We're Men\" from the first Spongebob movie started to play loudly as the two sea creatures who shouldn't even have had penises continued the succ.\n\nSquidward burst into Spongebob's room without knocking.\n\n\"Could you two-\" Squidward stopped yelling when he realized what he had walked in on.\n\nHis two retards of neighbors were currently fucking and God dammit if his squid dick didn't instantly harden. Squidward wished he had worn pants but that wasn't his main problem.\n\nSecretly, Squidward had always fantasised about this and that he'd be a part of the gang bang and now it could come true!\n\n\"Wanna join us, Squiddy?\" Spongebob asked, taking Patrick's wiener out of his mouth. He hastily nodded and jumped onto the bed.\n\nFrom the corner of the room, Garry the snail watched his owner get ass fucked over and over again by Squidward and Patrick long into the night before the three collapsed into a cum covered pile.",

I'm pounding this thing-I actually don't know how I didn't get irritated foreskin from the amount of friction-and I just feel my body reaching new heights of ecstasy. I'm looking Po's thick self and imagining her straddling my face. I mean who wouldn't; she's perfection. 6'5\". Brown Eyes. And a natural ass that puts all the Ms. Botoxs in the Hills to shame. So anyway I'm exhilarated. I actually can't even remember the moment I cum but a little hit the ceiling. And from that point I was hooked. 4 sometimes 5 times a day I started jacking it to Teletubby videos. But now every time I see anything somewhat related to Teletubbies I get uncontrollably hard. Teletubby toy? Erect. Wind Turbine? Erect. Pink Slime? I damn near pop right there and then: my biggest fantasy is Po rubbing that pink slime stuff on both of us so we can have intense, wet sex and practically revert to two retarded llamas attempting to procreate in a pile of mud. I haven't told anyone about this fetish and hope to break it soon but I haven't felt this alive while pleasing myself in a long time.",

            "response": "Hey guys, did you know that in terms of male human and female Pok√©mon breeding, Vaporeon is the most compatible Pok√©mon for humans? Not only are they in the field egg group, which is mostly comprised of mammals, Vaporeon are an average of 3\"03' tall and 63.9 pounds. this means they're large enough to be able to handle human dicks, and with their impressive Base stats for HP and access to Acid Armor, you can be rough with one. Due to their mostly water based biology, there's no doubt in my mind that an aroused Vaporeon would be incredibly wet, so wet that you could easily have sex with one for hours without getting sore. They can also learn the moves Attract, Baby-Doll eyes, Captivate, Charm and Tail Whip along with not having fur to hide nipples, so it'd be incredibly easy for one to get you in the mood. With their abilities Water Absorb and Hydration, they can easily recover from fatigue with enough water. No other Pok√©mon comes close with this level of compatibility. Also, fun fact, if you pull out enough, you can make your Vaporeon turn white. Vaporeon is literally built for human dick. Ungodly defense stat + high HP pool + Acid Armor means it can take cock all day, all shapes and sizes and still come for more.",

He took my wife and the kids and my house and my job. I swear to fucking god, I‚Äôm going to kill myself and take that goddamn elephant seal to hell with me. Wosh has ruined my family. Last summer, I approached the miserable seal in the street, and asked him for his autograph, because my son is a huge fan. The fucking blob gave me the autograph and told me to burn in hell. Later, when I gave my son the autograph he started crying and said he hated me. Turns out the Wosh didnt write his autograph, no, he wrote ‚Äúyou‚Äôre a piece of shit, and i fucked your mom‚Äù. I‚Äôm now divorced, and planning a huge class-action lawsuit against the devil that ruined my life. Your time is almost over, Wosh.

            "response": "Nintendo is a very Japanese company. It's their way or the highway. It's why certain games lack certain opitions or why decisions like these are made. They think it's the for the good of the game and the players, but obviously not everyone thinks that way. And telling them they're not right rarely leads to change. But they are doing some sort of backup save feature later on, so they are sorta listening. That being said, this has been happening for well over 2 decades now. I'm honestly surprised when people get upset knowing full well this is Nintendo and how stubborn they are. They have a certain way for players to play their games and that's just how it is. I remember people complaining about Splatoon 2 saves and that quickly died down. It's really no use getting upset over this. You either deal with Nintendo and their way of doing things or you simply move on from them. They haven't changed much since they began and they aren't going to anytime soon. And I wouldn't blame in on a single developer. It's 100% a decision by multiple people who think like Nogami.",

Their early work was a little too zombie survival for my tastes, but when battle royale came out in '18, I think they really came into their own, commercially and artistically. The whole game has a clear, crisp sound, and a new sheen of consummate professionalism that really gives the matches a big boost. He's been compared to PUBG, but I think Epic has a far more bitter, cynical sense of humor. In '17, Epic released this, Fortnite, their most accomplished video game. I think their undisputed masterpiece is \"American Boy Fortnite Parody \", a song so catchy, most people probably don't listen to the lyrics. But they should, because it's not just about the pleasures of conformity, and the importance of trends, it's also a personal statement about the company itself! \n\nHey Paul!"

Alright, keep that in mind, there are no yet know reason for people to be gay, and we don't know yet if homosexuality happens the same way between males and females. A lot of information have been suggested and accepted but non have been proven SCIENTIFICALLY, in fact, a lot of scientists deny that there is a relation between homosexuality and genes. The media is the one that spread the myth: \"Homosexuality is purely genetic\" And that's not true, here's why: A lot of scientists and gay supporters have been trying to prove that homosexuality is purely related to genes. An american biotech scientist studied the genetic indicator Xq28 that is found in chromosome X, which is indicator was suspected to connection with homosexuality.

We separated them and she actually broke out of her tank, climbed into his, fucked Bobo, and then mauled him so bad we took him to the vet. **Michelle was such a mean asshole. I hope that sex was consensual, because the mauling surely wasn't. She is pregnant again, has another litter. 18 hamsters now.**\n\nWe finally found a petshop that took most of them, and the rest were given to friends and family. One of them was a family friend. **The boy took two of them and named them 'Mocha' and 'Chocolate\" due to the fur. Their parents got them those like colorful tube palaces for the duo.** idk, you know what I mean. They are a bunch of tubes looping around so the hamsters can have fun or whatever, its like a rodent McDonalds Play Palace.\n\nBobo sadly passed not long after, so we just had this horny absolute bitch of a hamster, but at least not 18 of them. I remember throwing broccoli in their tank, it was like piranas eating a cow leg. Just instantly sunk down being devoured. Also, it was fun playing with all the baby hammies at once. I do admit, they were cute, but after it. **We just had that bitch whore hamster Michelle and were fine with that. **\n\n**So you know that colorful tube palace I mentioned? Well, one day we were at their place since they were having a birthday party for their youngest daughter.** Like 7 or some shit, idk i didn't know her. It was packed. They had a magician, and the largest ice cream cake you've ever seen. Pretty based."

I bolted to the back and they must had been out there for hours. They were basically liquid.

Well, what comfort could there be.**\n\n**Twisting Tubes that lead to so many places, yet none to freedom.**\n\n**I actually ended up getting into a fight with him, and everyone saw the commotion and came outside.** His parents broke us up, and his little sister who's birthday it was come out to see what is happening. Right away locks on to the McDonald's Play Palace of Agony. Hammy's Inferno. And sees their mangled liquidated furry corpses. She starts crying and screaming. Their are murmurs from all the guests as the dad and mom now focus on the daughter.\n\n**The boy looks pissed at me but what the fuck bro, you're the one that pulled a fucking Hamster Auschwitz in your backyard. I didn't do that, you did.** So I power walk into the house find my parent tell him what happened and he was like \"yeah, we don't wanna be here for that fallout.\" We book it. As we are leaving we can just hear the little sister's screeching and the magician is just playing with cards in the kitchen as we pass.\n\n**We stopped at 7/11 and got Slurpees because it was so unbelievably hot outside, and they just put their phone on silent.** We agreed that the next pet we get will be a fucking dog.
