The intent is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of Austrian economics most of the money will fly right out of a typical gamer\u2019s wallet. There\u2019s also EA\u2019s opportunistic scheming, which is deftly woven into its monetization- its corporate philosophy draws heavily from Hobbesian literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the sense of pride and accomplishment, to realize that they\u2019re not just looking at average per-player credit earn rates on a daily basis- they say something deep about challenges that are compelling, rewarding, and OF COURSE attainable via GAMEPLAY.\n\nAs a consequence, people who dislike Star Wars\u2122 Battlefront\u2122 2 truly ARE armchair developers- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in EA\u2019s existential catchphrase \u201cIt's In The Game,\u201d which itself is an ironic reference to Norah McClintock\u2019s young adult novel Truth And Lies. I\u2019m smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated nerf herders providing candid feedback in earnest as EA\u2019s avarice unfolds itself on their computer screens. What sheep.. how I pity them. \ud83d\ude02\n\nAnd yes, by the way, i DO have a Star Wars\u2122 Battlefront\u2122 2 tattoo. And no, you cannot see it.

Not a thing that I'm particularly proud of but I became quite good at it. I was taking zinc supplements so I was shooting massive loads and it became something of a sport to me. For anyone interested here is your best strategy. first, you need to find an isolated spot so you don't become a sex offender. I found a short kind of channel area where I saw the pigeons would congregate. Next, you arouse yourself. I was usually content with envisioning the occasional jogging lady coming over and taking a shit on my chest and that was enough to fuel the fire but if you're not as sexually charged as me just take some porn on the go. After you're good an horny, you get some bread. My pigeons preferred white bread but healthier birds might have a taste for honey wheat or maybe even multigrain. Fat, unhealthy birds are slower and easier to hit so remember that. Once you are seated on the bench and ready to do the deed, whip your roosevelt out and scatter bread out within a few feet of you. use your judgement based on how far you know you can cum. I was a lonely and depraved soul who could hit targets the size of a thimble at distances up to 4 feet. You wait for the pigeons to begin eating and to get comfortable with your presence. At this point, you want to coo gently and talk sensually to them to gain their trust. Now you're finally ready to cum on your bird. This is a tough part because the rapid motion of masturbation is very frightening to the birds, so you have to be subtle. Once you master a technique, you simply wind it up and let it go, aiming depending on your past cumming experiences. I always came high so I would aim for the neck of the bird and catch it right in the face. It's an extremely satisfying and erotic feeling, seeing those birds reel around covered in cum and maybe even transporting it to other places in the city.", "edited_at": "19/12/2020 17:07:18"}, "birf": {"author": {"id": 125765463299981313, "name": "dRed/dMist#7481"}, "command": "birf", "cooldowns": {}, "created_at": "19/12/2020 17:01:51", "editors": [125765463299981313], "response": "https://youtu.be/8RPaVPF1q2k", "edited_at": "19/12/2020 17:07:18"}, "bleach": {"author": {"id": 125765463299981313, "name": "dRed/dMist#7481"}, "command": "bleach", "cooldowns": {}, "created_at": "19/12/2020 17:01:51", "editors": [125765463299981313], "response": "The Pinnacle of manga <:vineTalian:467079595196153866>", "edited_at": "19/12/2020 17:07:18"}, "blueberry": {"author": {"id": 125765463299981313, "name": "dRed/dMist#7481"}, "command": "blueberry", "cooldowns": {}, "created_at": "19/12/2020 17:01:51", "editors": [125765463299981313], "response": "DO NOT DRINK MY VAPOGEON", "edited_at": "19/12/2020 17:07:18"}, "bongotime": {"author": {"id": 125765463299981313, "name": "dRed/dMist#7481"}, "command": "bongotime", "cooldowns": {}, "created_at": "19/12/2020 17:01:51", "editors": [125765463299981313], "response": "smack smack", "edited_at": "19/12/2020 17:07:18"}, "boom": {"author": {"id": 125765463299981313, "name": "dRed/dMist#7481"}, "command": "boom", "cooldowns": {}, "created_at": "19/12/2020 17:01:51", "editors": [125765463299981313], "response": "BOOM SMASHED IT AGAIN", "edited_at": "19/12/2020 17:07:18"}, "boomboom": {"author": {"id": 125765463299981313, "name": "dRed/dMist#7481"}, "command": "boomboom", "cooldowns": {}, "created_at": "19/12/2020 17:01:51", "editors": [125765463299981313], "response": "BOOM SMASHED IT AGAIN\nBOOM SMASHED IT AGAIN\nBOOM SMASHED IT AGAIN\nBOOM SMASHED IT AGAIN\nBOOM SMASHED IT AGAIN\nBOOM SMASHED IT AGAIN\nBOOM SMASHED IT AGAIN", "edited_at": "19/12/2020 17:07:18"}, "boss": {"author": {"id": 125765463299981313, "name": "dRed/dMist#7481"}, "command": "boss", "cooldowns": {}, "created_at": "19/12/2020 17:01:51", "editors": [125765463299981313], "response": "So I cummed on my boss's ass today.\nI work in an office and my boss is this sexy ass milf in her 30's with dat ass dat everything, always wearing tight business outfit skirts and pants showing off her sweet angus and tight body, i probably jack off to the thought of her atleast 5 times a week. Well lately weve been renovating the office and things are pretty tight in there to move around it kinda like a maze or some shiit. Well today im going out on break and theres these 2 desks beside eachother and theres barely any room for 2 people to walk by in and wut do i see, my boss walking towards me.\nI try to act cool but my face becomes flushed and it doesnt help that her tits are bouncing up and down as she walks, we get to the point of the desks at the same time and we kinda awkwardly try to walk by each other. We kinda get stuck a bit by the desks and shes facing away from me and her ass is right on my crotch, the second i feel this im in pure ecstasy and acquire a semi instantly. Her big juicy angus and me are now stuck and were trying to squeeze by each other and slowly moving through but her ass is grinding right up on me, i know i am about to cum and i tell her to move faster for the love of god, shes like wtf but i cannot stop at this point.\nI blow the biggest load this month so far and i get transported to another dimension, my fat load starts to leak through my pants and onto her skirt, shes turns her head and see this and says omg are u serious. We finally seperate and i fall to my knees and begin to speak in tongues, waves of more orgasms flood over me, i crap my pants and begin to cry. I was immediately fired but i feel like a new man now and will masturbate to this memory forever.", "edited_at": "19/12/2020 17:07:18"}, "bread": {"author": {"id": 125765463299981313, "name": "dRed/dMist#7481"}, "command": "bread", "cooldowns": {}, "created_at": "19/12/2020 17:01:51", "editors": [125765463299981313], "response": "i love annenrbread", "edited_at": "19/12/2020 17:07:18"}, "brother": {"author": {"id": 125765463299981313, "name": "dRed/dMist#7481"}, "command": "brother", "cooldowns": {}, "created_at": "19/12/2020 17:01:51", "editors": [125765463299981313], "response": "If my brother \ud83d\udc8f\ud83d\udc6bgot HIV \ud83d\udc89\ud83c\udfe5\ud83d\ude37\ud83d\udc80 it's bout to turn into HI-WE\ud83d\udc91cuz we in this together \ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude18", "edited_at": "19/12/2020 17:07:18"}, "bruh": {"author": {"id": 125765463299981313, "name": "dRed/dMist#7481"}, "command": "bruh", "cooldowns": {}, "created_at": "19/12/2020 17:01:51", "editors": [125765463299981313], "response": "bro you don't know what a Bruh moment is? *BRUH SOUND EFFECT* that's a bruh moment bro *BRUH SOUND EFFECT* you're cringe bro you make me cringe *BRUH SOUND EFFECT* you're a cringe compilation lol *BRUH SOUND EFFECT* I bet you don't even know what memes are I do I'm a memer", "edited_at": "19/12/2020 17:07:18"}, "bub": {"author": {"id": 125765463299981313, "name": "dRed/dMist#7481"}, "command": "bub", "cooldowns": {}, "created_at": "19/12/2020 17:01:51", "editors": [125765463299981313], "response": "*suckles hand in mouth*", "edited_at": "19/12/2020 17:07:18"}, "bubba": {"author": {"id": 125765463299981313, "name": "dRed/dMist#7481"}, "command": "bubba", "cooldowns": {}, "created_at": "19/12/2020 17:01:51", "editors": [125765463299981313], "response": "Alright so it *might* be possible to automate production of Ethereal Blooms\nI would have to find a better source of Praecantatio\nAnd Vitium\nIf I got both of those prepared, it might be possible to make these things automatically\nBecause the other two are really easy\nSano has become an absolute joke ever since I made that Boiler, and the other one is Herba which I can just get from seeds\nI'm probably gonna have to automate production of Silverwood?\nThey aren't effected by bonemeal sadly\nI'd have to pick it though because it both makes Praecantatio and Ordo\nI'm gonna get a Hoe of Growth\nI'm pretty sure that works on Silverwood Saplings\nOh one grew on it's own\nAlright, repaired a mistake I made using the Hoe of Growth\nI cut down one of the Pure Silverwoods a while ago, thinking that I needed the Auram essence from it\nIt did help with getting the first Totem of Dawn, but that place was at risk of infection\nI've got a good tree there now, with two nodes this time\nI'm gonna most certainly have to run down to the Silverwood Forest some time, and ensure that the place has only Pure Silverwoods\nThat'll make it easier to clean in the end\nThis gives me a new advantage too!\nI can grow my own Pure Nodes\nAnd they're pretty weak actually, too\nThey're mainly there so that the tree doesn't get infected by taint and spreads a small Magical Forest biome\nSo if I gather enough, I'll be able to feed them to my Main Node for the Light Essence system I'll have to make end-game", "edited_at": "19/12/2020 17:07:18"}, "bubba2": {"author": {"id": 125765463299981313, "name": "dRed/dMist#7481"}, "command": "bubba2", "cooldowns": {}, "created_at": "19/12/2020 17:01:51", "editors": [125765463299981313], "response": "God this is horrible\nI'm sitting at a furnace waiting for glass to smelt\nI need a reactor soon\nBut I wanna get the Botania Setup in that Infusion Altar working\nOnce I get that up, I'll try and make a generator\nBecause I need to automate production of Essentia now\nI've got the modification mostly complete now, but I still need to smelt more glass, ugh\nhttps://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/354825767919550467/442568568177950720/Capture.PNG\nAt least three of the four corners are done\nI'm having to add these tubes so that the Dayblooms and Nightshades that will be down there will have direct access to sunlight/moonlight\nI've got nine of the twelve tubes done\nI'm gonna make a generator and a mining laser now\nI need to get ore refining done\nOtherwise I'm gonna have to do this all manually\nUgh I don't like having to use my coal to make a reactor\nWhatever, it'll be worth it, I can hook up a Redstone Generator to it\nSo something I just discovered about this pack\nThey used an additional mod to remove the Quartz Grindstone from one of the mods(edited)\nYou have to use a god damn Iron Gear Box thing, and make a Grinder.

He starts to feed it to me while I'm sleeping. I'm a light sleeper, so this wakes me up, naturally I was confused, even more so because of the disorientation of sleep. He woke me up completely and told me that he 'got me some chocolate'. I ate it, as I was tired and unsure if I was having some sort of weird dream or what. After I ate it he told me that he'd rubbed it on our dogs nose before giving it to me. I didn't really care because I was so tired and just went back to sleep. The next morning I didn't really say anything because I was very confused and I wasn't sure if it was real. However, it kept happening, and he started asking me about it the morning after. One time he told me he farted on it before he fed it to me.\n\nHe also farts at me out the window often whenever I'm outside doing something. One time he farted at a kid who looked a little like me, and his parents came over and got mad at him. He still does this to me.\nAnother weird thing he does to me (or rather the dog) is grabs it's head and holds it to his ass, farts on her, and says to me, \"I wish this was you, Michael\", very angrily. Sometimes he farts multiple times on her and she tries to get away, I feel bad for her.", "edited_at": "19/12/2020 17:07:18"}, "don2": {"author": {"id": 125765463299981313, "name": "dRed/dMist#7481"}, "command": "don2", "cooldowns": {}, "created_at": "19/12/2020 17:01:51", "editors": [125765463299981313], "response": "He also shits his pants very often, about once every two weeks or so, that's only counting when I'm with him.

He said he just crouched over the water between two rocks, and that there were \"leaves everywhere\" so it was easy(??).\nMy mom called me once to tell me something, and Don was with her. Don asked if she was talking to me, so she gave him the phone, and he farted into it. It was a long fart, too. After like two minutes of me wondering what just happened, he said \"Michael, are you there?\" and I said \"Yes?\" and he said \"That was me farting\". I hung up then.\n\nSo that's what my weird step dad does.

I'm here in the capacity of the chariman of the national task force against homosexuality in Uganda.\n\nWe are making legislation to make sure that sodomy and homosexuality never sees the light of legality in this land of the part of Africa. I've taken time to do a little research to know what homosexuals do in the privacy of their bedroom. One of the thing they do is called anal licking, where the-, a man's anus is licked, like this, by the other person. Like ice cream. And then what happens, even poo-poo comes out. The other poo-poos out. And then they eat the poo-poo. The other one they do, is they have a sex practice called fisting where they insert their hand into the other man's hand and it goes all the-, into the anus all the way, and it is so painful they have to take drugs. But they enjoy it. Now if we have any children, please step out. This is a parental guidance moment. That child can be moved out. So, I've done research. This is what they do: Number one, you can see a man here having sucked the other person's rectum and the other person is poo-pooing, and this one is eating the poo-poo all over the place. Tell me, when you have a law against homosexuality do you say accept eating poo-poo? I mean look at these guyses here. Bishop. Aaaah, stagafiliza. Huh? Hajat? We do not want this sickness. This is sick, and it's therefore deviant; we do not want it.\n\nNow, they start off by touching each other's genitals and smearing each other. Then this one smears the poo-poo all over the other person's face. As if that is not enough he puts the hand deep. As Africans we want to ask Barrack Obama to explain to us, is this what he wants to bring to Africa? As a human right to eat the poo-poo of our children?", "edited_at": "19/12/2020 17:07:18"}, "hope": {"author": {"id": 125765463299981313, "name": "dRed/dMist#7481"}, "command": "hope", "cooldowns": {}, "created_at": "19/12/2020 17:01:51", "editors": [125765463299981313], "response": "https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/417439782507905026/469314951442595840/image.png", "edited_at": "19/12/2020 17:07:18"}, "horny": {"author": {"id": 125765463299981313, "name": "dRed/dMist#7481"}, "command": "horny", "cooldowns": {}, "created_at": "19/12/2020 17:01:51", "editors": [125765463299981313], "response": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bujjCkhswXE", "edited_at": "19/12/2020 17:07:18"}, "hounds": {"author": {"id": 125765463299981313, "name": "dRed/dMist#7481"}, "command": "hounds", "cooldowns": {}, "created_at": "19/12/2020 17:01:51", "editors": [125765463299981313], "response": "Tonight the streets are red,\nThe lights are blue and blinding.\nNo sign of the \"Good Doctor,\"\nBut the siren's wail and whining\nTell us he'll be found.\n\nI can almost hear the hounds...\n\nWhat kind of man builds a machine to kill a girl?\nNo he did not use his hands.\nLike a smart man, he used a tool.\nBut just the same,\nHow can you question who's to blame?\n\nWhat was her name?\n\nIt doesn't matter.\nNow listen...\n\"The Good Doctor\" has to pay!\n\nWhen I say he was a monster,\nWhen I set fire to his name,\nIt does not matter where you hear it from,\nWhether truth or lies,\nIt gets said all the same.\n\nWhatever's on the table plays!\n\nThere is a flame that I've been fanning.\nThere is a fire waiting to catch.\nThere is a hell that has been building\nFrom the moment we first met.\n\nIf there ever was a time,\nIf there ever was a chance,\nTo undo the things I've done\nAnd wash these bloodstains from my hands,\n\nIt has passed and been forgotten.\nThese are the paths that we must take.\nCause you and I, Tom, we are men\nAnd we can bend and we can break.\n\nIf you think that you can run,\nIf you think that you can stand,\nWell you forget who turned this city on.\nYou forget who plugged this city in!\n\nThey'll not switch it off again.\n\nOne by one they're tuning in.\n\n*Albert's place was here.

I was told there were no issues at my last checkup with Luke the Physician.\n\nI'm trying to explain that I'm a person who wishes to spread the word of God The Father.

I'm in bed by 11 PM, and make sure I get eight hours of sleep, no matter what. After having a glass of warm milk and doing about twenty minutes of stretches before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning. Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning. I was told there were no issues at my last check-up. I'm trying to explain that I'm a person who wishes to live a very quiet life. I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, like winning and losing, that would cause me to lose sleep at night.

I have hypothesized that the blue M&Ms as a race cannot survive long in the intense theater of competition that is the modern candy and snack-food world. Occasionally I will get a mutation, a candy that is misshapen, or pointier, or flatter than the rest. Almost invariably this proves to be a weakness, but on very rare occasions it gives the candy extra strength. In this way, the species continues to adapt to its environment. When I reach the end of the pack, I am left with one M&M, the strongest of the herd. Since it would make no sense to eat this one as well, I pack it neatly in an envelope and send it to M&M Mars, A Division of Mars, Inc., Hackettstown, NJ 17840-1503 U.S.A., along with a 3\u00d75 card reading, \u201cPlease use this M&M for breeding purposes.\u201d This week they wrote back to thank me, and sent me a coupon for a free 1/2 pound bag of plain M&Ms. I consider this \u201cgrant money.\u201d I have set aside the weekend for a grand tournament. From a field of hundreds, we will discover the True Champion. There can be only one.", "edited_at": "19/12/2020 17:07:18"}, "mahdick": {"author": {"id": 125765463299981313, "name": "dRed/dMist#7481"}, "command": "mahdick", "cooldowns": {}, "created_at": "19/12/2020 17:01:51", "editors": [125765463299981313], "response": "do you believe in muh dick, in a young girls mouth. when i cum i will free her, whenever it flows down south, and its mah dick. when its sucked it feels groovy, but please do not watch this porno movie. i'll tell you about mah dick. it'll free your soul. just ignore the big fat ugly mole. it's mah dick", "edited_at": "19/12/2020 17:07:18"}, "maneuvers": {"author": {"id": 125765463299981313, "name": "dRed/dMist#7481"}, "command": "maneuvers", "cooldowns": {}, "created_at": "19/12/2020 17:01:51", "editors": [125765463299981313], "response": "The jerk: 8==\ud83d\udc4a=D\ud83d\udca6\n\nThe poke: 8====D\ud83d\udc48\n\nThe boom: 8=\ud83d\udca5=D\ud83d\udca6\n\nThe twist: 8=\u270a\ud83d\udc4a=D\ud83d\udca6\n\nThe second round: 8====D\ud83d\udca7\n\nThe chop 8==\ud83d\udd2a=D\ud83d\udca6\n\nThe I haven't nutted in 27 days: 8==\ud83d\udc4a=D\u2614\n\nThe I made you some coffee: 8==\ud83d\udc4a=D\ud83d\udca6\u2615", "edited_at": "19/12/2020 17:07:18"}, "manga": {"author": {"id": 125765463299981313, "name": "dRed/dMist#7481"}, "command": "manga", "cooldowns": {}, "created_at": "19/12/2020 17:01:51", "editors": [125765463299981313], "response": "I wish I could learn how to draw manga and then creat the most outrageous, bullshit stupid things ever, someone is gonna pay good money to jerk off to it, like lesbian women milking eachother", "edited_at": "19/12/2020 17:07:18"}, "masculinity": {"author": {"id": 125765463299981313, "name": "dRed/dMist#7481"}, "command": "masculinity", "cooldowns": {}, "created_at": "19/12/2020 17:01:51", "editors": [125765463299981313], "response": "Yes agreed I have a very large penis and I ask women if it is big and they say \"yes very big\".

It presents an analytical approach to the class struggle (historical and then-present) and the problems of capitalism and the capitalist mode of production, rather than a prediction of communism's potential future forms.\n\nThe Communist Manifesto summarizes Marx and Engels' theories about the nature of society and politics, that in their own words, \"The history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles\".

Undertale Sans embodies everything that a character should be. He's heroic, comedic, has incredible abilities, and has a nostalgic connection to the players (after all, Undertale Sans is Ness).\n\nWith the announcement of Undertale and Smash Bros. taking place in the same Direct, I thought to myself, \"Could this really be a coincidence?\" Highly unlikely. After all, a Splatoon 2 expansion and Inkling Boy/Girl were both announced, so there's no way it was purely coincidental. If you take a look at the facts, it becomes painfully obvious how Undertale Sans will not only be in the game, but will also be Smash 5's flagship character.\n\nUndertale Sans is the perfect character for the game. Not only is he iconic, but he has enough moves and abilities to make for the deepest moveset in the game. Not only can he freeze time, he can teleport, attack with bones, and even poison opponents. Not only that, but he can also use his trademarked Gaster Blasters as smash attacks. For his Final Smash, he can stand there and do nothing, forcing players to reset their consoles. A perfect win.\n\nSince Undertale Sans and Ness are the same person, it seems fitting that they should remove Ness as a separate character entirely. Instead, Undertale Sans will play like Zelda/Shiek, with players being able to switch between the two. However, Ness will be considerably weaker, forcing players to play as Undertale Sans, his strongest and most superior form.\n\nFurthermore, the story mode will revolve around Undertale Sans. How, we don't know yet, but hopefully we will soon. However, this will lead Sakurai to put Undertale Sans on the front cover, and have him at the focal point of all commercials and posters so people know that this is Undertale Sans' game.", "edited_at": "19/12/2020 17:07:18"}, "smashbros": {"author": {"id": 125765463299981313, "name": "dRed/dMist#7481"}, "command": "smashbros", "cooldowns": {}, "created_at": "19/12/2020 17:01:51", "editors": [125765463299981313], "response": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1_k6XdAFLc", "edited_at": "19/12/2020 17:07:18"}, "smile": {"author": {"id": 125765463299981313, "name": "dRed/dMist#7481"}, "command": "smile", "cooldowns": {}, "created_at": "19/12/2020 17:01:51", "editors": [125765463299981313], "response": "\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u287f\u283f\u283f\u283f\u283f\u283f\u283f\u283f\u283f\u283f\u283f\u283f\u283f\u28bf\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff \n\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u285f\u28e9\u28f4\u28f6\u28fe\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28f7\u28f6\u28e6\u28cd\u28bb\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff \n\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28b8\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u2847\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff \n\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28b8\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u2847\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff \n\u28ff\u281f\u2809\u2804\u28b8\u28ff\u287f\u2809\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2819\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u280b\u2880\u2804\u2804\u2819\u28bf\u28ff\u2847\u2804\u2809\u283b\u28ff \n\u28ff\u2804\u2804\u2804\u28b8\u28ff\u28e7\u2804\u2808\u2804\u2804\u2880\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u2840\u2808\u2804\u2804\u2804\u28fc\u28ff\u2847\u2804\u2804\u2804\u28ff \n\u28ff\u28c4\u2804\u2804\u28b8\u287f\u28bf\u28f7\u28f6\u28f4\u28f6\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28f6\u28f6\u28f6\u28fe\u28ff\u28ff\u2847\u2804\u2804\u28e0\u28ff \n\u28ff\u28ff\u28f7\u28f6\u28b8\u28c4\u2860\u28cc\u2849\u2809\u2819\u281b\u281b\u281b\u283f\u283f\u281f\u281b\u2809\u2809\u2801\u2804\u2804\u2880\u28c6\u2847\u28f6\u28fe\u28ff\u28ff \n\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28b8\u28ff\u2858\u283f\u283b\u283f\u28c7\u2840\u28f4\u28ff\u2806\u28c0\u28fe\u28e7\u2804\u28f1\u28f7\u28f6\u281e\u2801\u28e1\u2847\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff \n\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28cc\u283b\u28ff\u28e6\u2840\u2811\u2839\u283f\u2818\u283f\u28fc\u2859\u287f\u28a1\u28ff\u2804\u2809\u2801\u28e0\u28fe\u289f\u28f1\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff \n\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28f7\u28ee\u285b\u28bf\u28f7\u28e4\u28c0\u2840\u2810\u280c\u2831\u2809\u2804\u2880\u28e0\u28f4\u287e\u288b\u28f5\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff \n\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28f7\u28ec\u28db\u283b\u28bf\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u283f\u281f\u28cb\u28e5\u28fe\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff \n\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28f7\u28f6\u28f6\u28f6\u28f6\u28fe\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff", "edited_at": "19/12/2020 17:07:18"}, "smough": {"author": {"id": 125765463299981313, "name": "dRed/dMist#7481"}, "command": "smough", "cooldowns": {}, "created_at": "19/12/2020 17:01:51", "editors": [125765463299981313], "response": "Afro, so you come to me, DJ Smough.

I had never felt so alive in my life. My hand just goes into overdrive. I'm pounding this thing-I actually don't know how I didn't get irritated foreskin from the amount of friction-and I just feel my body reaching new heights of ecstasy. I'm looking Po's thick self and imagining her straddling my face. I mean who wouldn't; she's perfection. 6'5\". Brown Eyes. And a natural ass that puts all the Ms. Botoxs in the Hills to shame. So anyway I'm exhilarated. I actually can't even remember the moment I cum but a little hit the ceiling. And from that point I was hooked. 4 sometimes 5 times a day I started jacking it to Teletubby videos. But now every time I see anything somewhat related to Teletubbies I get uncontrollably hard. Teletubby toy? Erect. Wind Turbine? Erect. Pink Slime? I damn near pop right there and then: my biggest fantasy is Po rubbing that pink slime stuff on both of us so we can have intense, wet sex and practically revert to two retarded llamas attempting to procreate in a pile of mud. I haven't told anyone about this fetish and hope to break it soon but I haven't felt this alive while pleasing myself in a long time.", "edited_at": "19/12/2020 17:07:18"}, "th": {"author": {"id": 125765463299981313, "name": "dRed/dMist#7481"}, "command": "th", "cooldowns": {}, "created_at": "19/12/2020 17:01:51", "editors": [125765463299981313], "response": "https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/489998860387876865/494274110025629696/thnglk.PNG", "edited_at": "19/12/2020 17:07:18"}, "thicc": {"author": {"id": 125765463299981313, "name": "dRed/dMist#7481"}, "command": "thicc", "cooldowns": {}, "created_at": "19/12/2020 17:01:51", "editors": [125765463299981313], "response": "Ken I have a thicc ok ri to s", "edited_at": "19/12/2020 17:07:18"}, "thickfacade": {"author": {"id": 125765463299981313, "name": "dRed/dMist#7481"}, "command": "thickfacade", "cooldowns": {}, "created_at": "19/12/2020 17:01:51", "editors": [125765463299981313], "response": "In my opinion, this is one of Mike's worst streams.

Not only are they in the field egg group, which is mostly comprised of mammals, Vaporeon are an average of 3\"03' tall and 63.9 pounds. this means they're large enough to be able to handle human dicks, and with their impressive Base stats for HP and access to Acid Armor, you can be rough with one. Due to their mostly water based biology, there's no doubt in my mind that an aroused Vaporeon would be incredibly wet, so wet that you could easily have sex with one for hours without getting sore. They can also learn the moves Attract, Baby-Doll eyes, Captivate, Charm and Tail Whip along with not having fur to hide nipples, so it'd be incredibly easy for one to get you in the mood. With their abilities Water Absorb and Hydration, they can easily recover from fatigue with enough water. No other Pok\u00e9mon comes close with this level of compatibility. Also, fun fact, if you pull out enough, you can make your Vaporeon turn white. Vaporeon is literally built for human dick. Ungodly defense stat + high HP pool + Acid Armor means it can take cock all day, all shapes and sizes and still come for more.", "edited_at": "19/12/2020 17:07:18"}, "vinny": {"author": {"id": 125765463299981313, "name": "dRed/dMist#7481"}, "command": "vinny", "cooldowns": {}, "created_at": "19/12/2020 17:01:51", "editors": [125765463299981313], "response": "Vinny is laying on an examination table.

It's their way or the highway. It's why certain games lack certain opitions or why decisions like these are made. They think it's the for the good of the game and the players, but obviously not everyone thinks that way. And telling them they're not right rarely leads to change. But they are doing some sort of backup save feature later on, so they are sorta listening. That being said, this has been happening for well over 2 decades now. I'm honestly surprised when people get upset knowing full well this is Nintendo and how stubborn they are. They have a certain way for players to play their games and that's just how it is. I remember people complaining about Splatoon 2 saves and that quickly died down. It's really no use getting upset over this. You either deal with Nintendo and their way of doing things or you simply move on from them. They haven't changed much since they began and they aren't going to anytime soon.
